# Mid-Proterozoic-Field

Raw data and MATLAB codes of the manuscript titled "Mid-Proterozoic geomagnetic field was more consistent with a dipole than a quadrupole"
contributed by Gong, Z., Evans, D. A. D., Zhang, Z., and Yan, C.

(1) to reproduce best-fit models, run "forward_dipole.m" and "forward_quadrupole.m" files under the "best_fit" folder

(2) to reproduce monte-carlo simulations, run "MCforwarddipole.m" and "MCforwardquadrupole.m" under the "monte_carlo" folder

(3) to read paleomagnetic data, check csv files under the "pmag_data" folder

(4) to get plate polygons, check shapefiles under the "plate_polygon" folder
