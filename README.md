(1) to reproduce best-fit models, run "forward_dipole.m" and "forward_quadrupole.m" files under "best_fit" folder

(2) to reproduce monte-carlo simulations, run "MCforwarddipole.m" and "MCforwardquadrupole.m" under "monte_carlo" folder

(3) to review paleomagnetic data, check csv files under "pmag_data" folder

(4) to review plate polygons, check shapefiles under "plate_polygon" folder
